          <!--Paragraph 1-->
          <p class="text">
            Jean Tannen is a young thief from Camorr and a member of the
            Gentlemen Bastards. He is the companion and best friend of Locke
            Lamora. Before becoming Father Chains’ pezon Jean lived an honest,
            comfortable life in North Corner as an only child, alongside his
            merchant parents. This part of his life came to an abrupt and tragic
            end at the age of ten, when the shop burnt to the ground, taking his
            family and former life with it. Jean then became an initiate of the
            Nameless Thirteenth, learnt weaponry with Don Maranzalla and became
            affiliated into Aza Guilla’s priesthood. Despite their turbulent
            start, Jean and Locke forged an unlikely friendship, whereupon Jean
            became utterly devoted to his garrista.

          <!--Paragraph 2-->
          <p class="text">
            Tavrin Callas was an alias used in an elaborate plan to rob two
            nobles, Don Salvara and Doña Salvara, of their fortune through a
            plan to ship Austershalin Brandy to them through illicit galleons.
            Of course, the money the Salvaras paid "Lukas Fehrwight" actually
            went straight to the Elderglass cellar where Jean and his
            associates lived.

            Locke devices a plan to rob the wealthiest man in Tel Verrar, namely
            the master of the famous gambling house The Sinspire, Requin. The
            preparations for the game takes two entire years during which Locke
            and Jean, his assosiate, cement their false identities of Leocanto
            Kosta and Jerome de Ferra.

          <!--Paragraph 4-->
          <p class="text">
            Jerome Valora was an alias given to him by bondsmagi, a group of
            magicans, in which he was instructed with the task of winning a
            political campaign. The alias already had a bank account and a good
            reputation as political consultants. Additionally, the group he was
            assosated with, had been "adjusted" to make their power more or less
            absolute.
