          <!--Paragraph 1-->
          <p class="text">
            Locke Lamora is the main protagonist of the series and a young thief
            from Camorr and was the garrista of the Gentlemen Bastards for a
            time. He is a master thief, confidence artist and false-facer,
            having been trained from a very young age in the art of deception
            and thieving by Father Chains. He is known by the Camorri nobility
            as The Thorn of Camorr, a legendary thief who violates the Secret
            Peace of Camorr by bringing Camorri nobles into his confidence and
            duping them out of vast sums of their gold. He is also known by many
            other aliases, depending on what confidence games he and his
            associates are running at any given time. His true name is unknown
            to even himself.

          <!--Paragraph 2-->
          <p class="text">
            Lucas Fehrwright was an alias used in an elaborate plan to rob two
            nobles, Don Salvara and Do√±a Salvara, of their fortune through a
            plan to ship Austershalin Brandy to them through illicit galleons.
            Of course, the money the Salvaras paid "Lukas Fehrwight" actually
            went straight to the Elderglass cellar where Locke and his
            associates lived.

          <!--Paragraph 4-->
          <p class="text">
            Sebastian Lazari was an alias given to him by bondsmagi, a group of
            magicans, in which he was instructed with the task of winning a
            political campaign. The alias already had a bank account and a good
            reputation as political consultants. Additionally, the group he was
            assosated with, had been "adjusted" to make their power more or less
            absolute.
